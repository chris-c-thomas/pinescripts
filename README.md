## Overview

Each family targets a distinct layer of the analysis process. Together, they form a top-down framework: establish macro context, assess directional bias across a watchlist, then execute with precision timing.

| Layer | Family | Role |
|:------|:-------|:-----|
| Strategic Context | [Trend Compass](#trend-compass) | Multi-day, multi-week, and intraday structural trend phase, strength, and divergence detection |
| Reconnaissance | [Market Monitor](#market-monitor) | Directional bias scoring for multi-chart watchlist monitoring |
| Execution | [SPY 0DTE Scalper](#spy-0dte-scalper) | Intraday signal generation for SPY zero-days-to-expiration options |

All scripts are written in Pine Script v6 and run as chart overlays. Every indicator includes a real-time dashboard, configurable inputs, and a dual alert system (static `alertcondition` entries for TradingView alerts and dynamic `alert()` calls for webhook pipelines).

## SPY 0DTE Scalper

Purpose-built for scalping SPY 0DTE options. Each variant is tightly coupled to its specific timeframe, employing strict AND-gate logic across price structure, volume, momentum, and candlestick patterns to filter out low-probability setups.

| Variant | Script | Docs | Base Signal | Key Filters | Target Environment |
|:--------|:-------|:-----|:------------|:------------|:-------------------|
| **1-Minute** | [`spy_0dte_scalper_1min.pine`](scripts/spy_0dte_scalper/spy_0dte_scalper_1min.pine) | [docs](docs/spy_0dte_scalper/spy_0dte_scalper_1min.md) | 9/21 EMA Cross | VWAP, RSI, Engulfing/Pinbar | High-frequency momentum scalping |

## Market Monitor

Designed for multi-chart grid layouts (e.g., 6-8 charts per screen). The Market Monitor replaces cluttered signal arrows with a clean, glanceable directional bias score, allowing you to quickly assess the market breadth and structural alignment of your entire watchlist.

## Trend Compass

The strategic context layer. Evaluates the lifecycle of a trend (Emerging → Accelerating → Mature → Exhausting → Consolidating → Reversing) while plotting institutional-grade higher-timeframe reference levels directly on the local chart.

| Variant | Script | Docs | HTF References | Divergence Config | Cadence |
|:--------|:-------|:-----|:---------------|:------------------|:--------|
| **Daily** | [`trend_compass_daily.pine`](scripts/trend_compass/trend_compass_daily.pine) | [docs](docs/trend_compass/trend_compass_daily.md) | Weekly 50, Prior M/W H/L/C | 5L/5R pivots, 60-bar decay | 1 bar per session |
| **4-Hour** | [`trend_compass_4h.pine`](scripts/trend_compass/trend_compass_4h.pine) | [docs](docs/trend_compass/trend_compass_4h.md) | Daily 50, Daily 200, Weekly 50 | 4L/2R pivots, 20-bar decay | ~2 bars per session |
| **1-Hour** | [`trend_compass_1h.pine`](scripts/trend_compass/trend_compass_1h.pine) | [docs](docs/trend_compass/trend_compass_1h.md) | 4H 50, Daily 50, Daily 200, Weekly 50 | 3L/2R pivots, 30-bar decay | ~6.5 bars per session |
| **15-Minute** | [`trend_compass_15m.pine`](scripts/trend_compass/trend_compass_15m.pine) | [docs](docs/trend_compass/trend_compass_15min.md) | 1H 50, 4H 50, Daily 50, Daily 200 | 3L/2R pivots, 40-bar decay | 26 bars per session |

Each variant is calibrated for its timeframe: compression thresholds, EMA slope sensitivity, crossover windows, and divergence pivot parameters all scale appropriately. The 15-minute and 1-hour variants provide the fastest divergence feedback and intraday trend assessment, while the Daily variant provides the broadest structural picture with the least noise.
