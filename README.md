## Overview

Each family targets a distinct layer of the analysis process. Together, they form a top-down framework: establish macro context, assess directional bias across a watchlist, then execute with precision timing.

| Layer | Family | Role |
|:------|:-------|:-----|
| Strategic Context | [Trend Compass](#trend-compass) | Multi-day and multi-week trend phase, strength, and divergence detection |
| Reconnaissance | [Market Monitor](#market-monitor) | Directional bias scoring for multi-chart watchlist monitoring |
| Execution | [SPY 0DTE Scalper](#spy-0dte-scalper) | Intraday signal generation for SPY zero-days-to-expiration options |

All scripts are written in Pine Script v6 and run as chart overlays. Every indicator includes a real-time dashboard, configurable inputs, and a dual alert system (static `alertcondition` entries for TradingView alerts and dynamic `alert()` calls for webhook pipelines).

## SPY 0DTE Scalper

Purpose-built for scalping SPY 0DTE options. Each timeframe variant generates explicit CALLS and PUTS signal labels using AND-gate confluence logic — all required conditions must pass simultaneously before a signal fires. Signals are gated by `barstate.isconfirmed` to prevent repainting.

Core components shared across all variants:

- **EMA Ribbon** with dynamic cloud fill for trend structure
- **Session VWAP** with standard deviation bands
- **TTM Squeeze** detection (Bollinger Band compression inside Keltner Channels)
- **NYSE TICK Index** integration with six-tier breadth classification
- **Session levels** — Pre-Market High/Low, Opening Range, Session HOD/LOD
- **Prior Day VWAP** as an institutional reference level
- **Regime classifier** — BULLISH, BEARISH, RANGING, NO TRADE, TRANSITION
- **Signal filters** — time window, cooldown, bar confirmation, ADX gate, VWAP extension, optional squeeze and TICK filters

### Variants

| Timeframe | Script | Documentation | Hold Duration | Signals per Session |
|:----------|:-------|:--------------|:--------------|:--------------------|
| 1-minute | [spy_0dte_scalper_1min.pine](spy_0dte_scalper/spy_0dte_scalper_1min.pine) | [docs](docs/spy_0dte_scalper_1min.md) | 1 -- 5 min | Highest frequency |
| 5-minute | [spy_0dte_scalper_5min.pine](spy_0dte_scalper/spy_0dte_scalper_5min.pine) | [docs](docs/spy_0dte_scalper_5min.md) | 5 -- 25 min | Moderate frequency |
| 15-minute | [spy_0dte_scalper_15min.pine](spy_0dte_scalper/spy_0dte_scalper_15min.pine) | [docs](docs/spy_0dte_scalper_15min.md) | 15 -- 60 min | Highest conviction |

The 1-minute variant uses a strict AND-gate engine requiring all five core conditions. The 5-minute and 15-minute variants use a weighted scoring system that allows partial confluence while still requiring minimum thresholds, and add session phase detection (Open Drive, Morning, Midday, Power Hour, Close) with bias trend tracking.

## Market Monitor

Lightweight directional-bias overlays designed for multi-chart watchlist monitoring across 6-8 simultaneous charts. These indicators produce no signal labels — they exist purely to communicate trend context, momentum state, and directional bias at a glance.

Core components shared across both variants:

- **EMA Ribbon** (9/21/50) with trend cloud fill
- **Session VWAP** with configurable standard deviation bands
- **RSI and ADX** momentum engine
- **ATR** volatility measurement with regime classification
- **Relative volume** gauge
- **Higher timeframe EMA** confirmation layer
- **Previous Day High/Low/Close** reference levels
- **Compact dashboard** optimized for small chart tiles

### Variants

| Timeframe | Script | Documentation | Bias Score Range | Key Additions |
|:----------|:-------|:--------------|:-----------------|:--------------|
| Adaptive (1m -- Daily) | [market_monitor_1min.pine](market_monitor/market_monitor_1min.pine) | [docs](docs/market_monitor_1min.md) | -5 to +5 | Binary scoring, minimal object count for 8+ instances |
| 5-minute | [market_monitor_5min.pine](market_monitor/market_monitor_5min.pine) | [docs](docs/market_monitor_5min.md) | -11 to +11 | Weighted scoring, session phases, TICK, TTM Squeeze, Opening Range |

The 1-minute variant uses a simple binary scoring system where five conditions each contribute +/-1 point. The 5-minute variant introduces weighted scoring (structural conditions at 2x, confirmation conditions at 1x), NYSE TICK integration, TTM Squeeze detection, session HOD/LOD tracking, Opening Range levels, and bias trend tracking (IMPROVING / STABLE / FADING).

## Trend Compass

Strategic trend assessment overlays for equities, ETFs, and indices. Ticker-agnostic by design — these work on any liquid instrument. No signal generation. Pure trend context answering: What is the trend? How strong is it? Accelerating or exhausting? Are divergences forming? Where is price relative to institutional structure?

Core components shared across all variants:

- **EMA Ribbon** (10/21/50) with 200 EMA anchor as the institutional dividing line
- **Trend phase classifier** with six states — EMERGING, ACCELERATING, MATURE, EXHAUSTING, CONSOLIDATING, REVERSING
- **Composite weighted trend score** (-11 to +11) from eight conditions across structural (2x weight) and confirmation (1x weight) tiers
- **Score trend tracking** — IMPROVING, STABLE, FADING via smoothed comparison
- **RSI divergence detection** — bullish, bearish, hidden bullish, hidden bearish with visual line segments on the chart
- **MACD divergence detection** with four states and dotted line visualization
- **ADX slope analysis** — RISING, FLAT, FALLING
- **OBV trend confirmation** — CONFIRMING, DIVERGING, NEUTRAL
- **ATR percentile ranking** and **Bollinger Band width percentile** for volatility context
- **52-week High/Low** with position-in-range percentage
- **Prior period High/Low/Close** reference levels
- **Optional modules** — Fibonacci retracement and Ichimoku Cloud (togglable)

### Variants

| Timeframe | Script | Documentation | HTF Anchors | Divergence Sensitivity | Update Frequency |
|:----------|:-------|:--------------|:------------|:-----------------------|:-----------------|
| Daily | [trend_compass_daily.pine](trend_compass/trend_compass_daily.pine) | [docs](docs/trend_compass_daily.md) | Weekly 50 EMA | 5L/3R pivots, 15-bar decay | 1 bar per session |
| 4-hour | [trend_compass_4h.pine](trend_compass/trend_compass_4h.pine) | [docs](docs/trend_compass_4h.md) | Daily 50, Daily 200, Weekly 50 | 4L/2R pivots, 20-bar decay | ~2 bars per session |
| 1-hour | [trend_compass_1h.pine](trend_compass/trend_compass_1h.pine) | [docs](docs/trend_compass_1h.md) | 4H 50, Daily 50, Daily 200, Weekly 50 | 3L/2R pivots, 30-bar decay | ~6.5 bars per session |

Each variant is calibrated for its timeframe: compression thresholds, EMA slope sensitivity, crossover windows, and divergence pivot parameters all scale appropriately. The 1-hour variant provides the fastest divergence feedback and intraday trend assessment. The Daily variant provides the broadest structural picture with the least noise.
