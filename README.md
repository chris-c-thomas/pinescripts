## Overview

Each family targets a distinct layer of the analysis process. Together, they form a top-down framework: establish macro context, identify correction/re-entry zones, assess directional bias across a watchlist, analyze intraday conditions, and execute with precision timing — with a dedicated mobile companion for when you're away from the desk.

| Layer | Family | Role |
|:------|:-------|:-----|
| Strategic Context | [Trend Compass](#trend-compass) | Multi-day, multi-week, and intraday structural trend phase, strength, and divergence detection |
| Bottom Detection | [Bottom Level Finder](#bottom-level-finder) | Multi-horizon correction/re-entry framework with Fibonacci, drawdown, and MA support levels |
| Reconnaissance | [Market Monitor](#market-monitor) | Directional bias scoring for multi-chart watchlist monitoring |
| Intraday Analysis | [Intraday Analyst](#intraday-analyst) | Ticker-agnostic intraday signal generation and context for equities, ETFs, and cash indices |
| Execution | [SPY 0DTE Scalper](#spy-0dte-scalper) | Intraday signal generation for SPY zero-days-to-expiration options |
| Mobile | [Pocket Scout](#pocket-scout) | Mobile-first intraday bias tool for iPhone viewing of liquid US equity ETFs |

All scripts are written in Pine Script v6 and run as chart overlays. Every indicator includes a real-time dashboard and configurable inputs. Most include a dual alert system (static `alertcondition` entries for TradingView alerts and dynamic `alert()` calls for webhook pipelines); Bottom Level Finder is alert-free by design.

## Trend Compass

The strategic context layer. Evaluates the lifecycle of a trend (Emerging → Accelerating → Mature → Exhausting → Consolidating → Reversing) while plotting institutional-grade higher-timeframe reference levels directly on the local chart.

| Variant | Script | Docs | HTF References | Divergence Config | Cadence |
|:--------|:-------|:-----|:---------------|:------------------|:--------|
| **Daily** | [`trend-compass-daily.pine`](scripts/trend-compass/trend-compass-daily.pine) | [docs](docs/trend-compass/trend-compass-daily.md) | Weekly 50, Prior M/W H/L/C | 5L/5R pivots, 60-bar decay | 1 bar per session |
| **4-Hour** | [`trend-compass-4h.pine`](scripts/trend-compass/trend-compass-4h.pine) | [docs](docs/trend-compass/trend-compass-4h.md) | Daily 50, Daily 200, Weekly 50 | 4L/2R pivots, 20-bar decay | ~2 bars per session |
| **1-Hour** | [`trend-compass-1h.pine`](scripts/trend-compass/trend-compass-1h.pine) | [docs](docs/trend-compass/trend-compass-1h.md) | 4H 50, Daily 50, Daily 200, Weekly 50 | 3L/2R pivots, 30-bar decay | ~6.5 bars per session |
| **15-Minute** | [`trend-compass-15m.pine`](scripts/trend-compass/trend-compass-15m.pine) | [docs](docs/trend-compass/trend-compass-15min.md) | 1H 50, 4H 50, Daily 50, Daily 200 | 3L/2R pivots, 40-bar decay | 26 bars per session |

Each variant is calibrated for its timeframe: compression thresholds, EMA slope sensitivity, crossover windows, and divergence pivot parameters all scale appropriately. The 15-minute and 1-hour variants provide the fastest divergence feedback and intraday trend assessment, while the Daily variant provides the broadest structural picture with the least noise.

## Bottom Level Finder

A multi-horizon bottom and support level identification overlay designed for correction analysis and re-entry timing. A single Horizon Mode selector (1D, 5D, 1M, 3M, 6M, 1Y, 5Y) reconfigures the entire indicator — drawdown granularity, moving average suite, MA cross pair, signal thresholds, and VIX sensitivity — to match TradingView's zoom presets. The chart timeframe stays on Daily (D) across all modes.

| Variant | Script | Docs | Chart TF | Modes | Key Features |
|:--------|:-------|:-----|:---------|:------|:-------------|
| **Unified** | [`bottom-level-finder.pine`](scripts/bottom-level-finder/bottom-level-finder.pine) | [docs](docs/bottom-level-finder/bottom-level-finder.md) | Daily | 7 horizons via dropdown | Fibonacci, Drawdown ladder, 4 MAs, MA cross, VIX, 6-factor scorecard |

Layers three independent analytical frameworks onto one chart: Fibonacci retracement levels (anchored from ATH to a user-defined or auto-detected cycle low), percentage drawdown levels from ATH with mode-adaptive granularity (-0.5% steps for 1D up to -10% steps for 5Y), and a mode-adaptive moving average suite with cross detection. A six-factor bottom signal scorecard (RSI oversold, BB %B breach, momentum turn, MA support test, VIX elevation, volume capitulation) assesses proximity to a durable bottom, classified as NONE / LOW / MODERATE / ELEVATED / EXTREME.

The indicator does not generate buy/sell signals. It provides a structured framework of price levels and condition monitoring to inform re-entry timing decisions during corrections. `request.security()` budget: 3 calls (Weekly tuple, Monthly MACD tuple, VIX). No alert system by design — this is a visual chart analysis tool, not a notification pipeline.

## Market Monitor

Designed for multi-chart grid layouts (e.g., 6-8 charts per screen). The Market Monitor replaces cluttered signal arrows with a clean, glanceable directional bias score, allowing you to quickly assess the market breadth and structural alignment of your entire watchlist.

| Variant | Script | Docs | Anchor | Session Tracking | Unique Features |
|:--------|:-------|:-----|:-------|:-----------------|:----------------|
| **1-Minute** | [`market-monitor-1min.pine`](scripts/market-monitor/market-monitor-1min.pine) | [docs](docs/market-monitor/market-monitor-1min.md) | Session VWAP | N/A | Lightweight, adaptive, equal-weight scoring |
| **5-Minute** | [`market-monitor-5min.pine`](scripts/market-monitor/market-monitor-5min.pine) | [docs](docs/market-monitor/market-monitor-5min.md) | 15m EMA | 5m Phase Intervals | TTM Squeeze, TICK, Weighted Scoring (-11 to +11) |
| **15-Minute** | [`market-monitor-15min.pine`](scripts/market-monitor/market-monitor-15min.pine) | [docs](docs/market-monitor/market-monitor-15min.md) | 1H EMA | 15m Phase Intervals | TTM Squeeze, TICK, Session-level stability bias |

## Intraday Analyst

Ticker-agnostic intraday signal generation and context assessment. Two variants cover the full instrument spectrum: one for equities and ETFs (which have volume data), one for CBOE cash indices (which do not). Both share the same architectural DNA — EMA ribbon, HTF anchor, scoring engine, session levels, phase detection, regime classifier, and dashboard — but differ in how they handle fair-value anchoring and volume confirmation.

| Variant | Script | Docs | Fair Value | Volume Stack | Vol Index Default | Target Instruments |
|:--------|:-------|:-----|:-----------|:-------------|:-----------------|:-------------------|
| **Equity** | [`equity-intraday-analyst.pine`](scripts/intraday-analyst/equity-intraday-analyst.pine) | [docs](docs/intraday-analyst/equity-intraday-analyst.md) | Session VWAP | VWAP, OBV, Relative Vol | OFF (opt-in) | SPY, QQQ, IWM, NVDA, TSLA, GOOGL, AAPL, etc. |
| **Index** | [`index-intraday-analyst.pine`](scripts/intraday-analyst/index-intraday-analyst.pine) | [docs](docs/intraday-analyst/index-intraday-analyst.md) | Session TWAP | None (no volume on CBOE) | ON (configurable) | SPX, NDX, RUT, DJX |

Both variants are timeframe-adaptive (1-minute, 5-minute, 10-minute, 15-minute) — opening range duration, ATR lookbacks, divergence sensitivity, signal cooldown, and HTF anchor mapping auto-adjust based on the chart timeframe.

**Equity variant** includes the full volume stack: session-anchored VWAP with standard deviation bands, OBV trend confirmation (CONFIRMING / DIVERGING), relative volume classification (SPIKE / ABOVE / NORMAL / DRY), and prior day VWAP close. VIX context is available as an opt-in toggle for SPY and QQQ. Weighted scoring max: +/-15.

**Index variant** substitutes session TWAP (time-weighted average price) for VWAP, adds a configurable companion volatility index (CBOE:VIX for SPX, CBOE:VXN for NDX, CBOE:RVX for RUT, CBOE:VXD for DJX), and uses Stochastic K/D in the confirmation slot that OBV occupies in the equity variant. Weighted scoring max: +/-13.

## SPY 0DTE Scalper

Purpose-built for scalping SPY 0DTE options. Each variant is tightly coupled to its specific timeframe, employing strict AND-gate logic across price structure, volume, momentum, and candlestick patterns to filter out low-probability setups. All three variants integrate volume footprint data via `request.footprint()` (Premium/Ultimate plan required) for intrabar order flow visibility — POC levels, delta classification, and buy/sell volume displayed in the dashboard.

| Variant | Script | Docs | Base Signal | Key Filters | Target Environment |
|:--------|:-------|:-----|:------------|:------------|:-------------------|
| **1-Minute** | [`spy-0dte-scalper-1min.pine`](scripts/spy-0dte-scalper/spy-0dte-scalper-1min.pine) | [docs](docs/spy-0dte-scalper/spy-0dte-scalper-1min.md) | 9/21 EMA Cross | VWAP, RSI, Engulfing/Pinbar, Footprint (info) | High-frequency momentum scalping |
| **5-Minute** | [`spy-0dte-scalper-5min.pine`](scripts/spy-0dte-scalper/spy-0dte-scalper-5min.pine) | [docs](docs/spy-0dte-scalper/spy-0dte-scalper-5min.md) | MACD Cross | VWAP, RSI, 9/21 EMA, Footprint (opt-in) | Standard intraday trend following |
| **15-Minute** | [`spy-0dte-scalper-15min.pine`](scripts/spy-0dte-scalper/spy-0dte-scalper-15min.pine) | [docs](docs/spy-0dte-scalper/spy-0dte-scalper-15min.md) | MACD Cross | VWAP, RSI, 9/21 EMA, Footprint+POC | Session-level structural swings |

## Pocket Scout

Mobile-first intraday directional bias tool purpose-built for iPhone portrait viewing of liquid US equity ETFs. Compresses the essential directional context into an 8-row `size.huge` dashboard with a merged bias banner row, leaving ~70% of chart real estate for price action.

| Variant | Script | Docs | Timeframe Scope | Symbol Scope | Vol Index |
|:--------|:-------|:-----|:----------------|:-------------|:----------|
| **Unified** | [`pocket-scout.pine`](scripts/pocket-scout/pocket-scout.pine) | [docs](docs/pocket-scout/pocket-scout.md) | Adaptive 1m / 5m / 15m | SPY, QQQ, IWM, DIA (+ leveraged siblings) | Auto-detect (VIX / VXN / RVX) |

Ticker-agnostic within the liquid US equity ETF family — auto-detects the appropriate companion volatility index (VIX for SPY/DIA, VXN for QQQ, RVX for IWM). The HTF Anchor EMA adapts automatically: 1m → 15m, 5m → 1h, 15m → 4h.

**Design philosophy**: ruthless information hierarchy. Desktop indicators with 18-26 row dashboards are unusable on iPhone portrait; the fix is not shrinking text (illegible at a glance) but cutting rows. Pocket Scout uses a 6-condition weighted scoring engine — structural 2x (EMA stack, VWAP, HTF Anchor) + confirmation 1x (RSI, MACD, Vol slope), max ±9 — and reserves divergences, TTM Squeeze, ADX/DI, TICK, and signal arrows to the desktop tools. It is a pocket companion, not a replacement.

`request.security()` budget: 4 calls (HTF Anchor, Prior Day tuple [H/L/C/open], Vol index close, Vol index daily open). Four high-signal alerts: STRONG BULL, STRONG BEAR, PDH cross, PDL cross.
